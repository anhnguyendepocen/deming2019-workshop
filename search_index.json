Participants will perform hands-on implementation of state-of-the-art targeted maximum likelihood estimators using the tlverse software ecosystem in the R programming language. Participants will actively learn and apply the core principles of the Targeted Learning methodology, which (1) generalizes machine learning to any estimand of interest; (2) obtains an optimal estimator of the given estimand, grounded in theory; (3) integrates modern ensemble machine learning techniques; and (4) provides formal statistical inference in terms of confidence intervals and testing of specified null hypotheses of interest. It is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming language will be essential. 2-Day Short Course – 8A-5P on December 5-6, 2019 Targeted Learning in Data Science: Causal Inference for Observational and Experimental Data This 2-day short course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of targeted learning for causal inference and the corresponding tlverse software ecosystem. We will focus on targeted minimum loss-based estimators of causal effects, including those of static, dynamic, optimal dynamic, and stochastic interventions. These multiply robust, efficient plug-in estimators use state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning tools to flexibly adjust for confounding while yielding valid statistical inference. Estimators will be explored under various real-world scenarios: when the outcome is subject to missingness, when mediators are present on the causal pathway, in high dimensions, under two-phase sampling designs, and in right-censored survival settings possibly subject to competing risks. We will discuss the utility of this robust estimation strategy in comparison to conventional techniques, which often rely on restrictive statistical models and may therefore lead to severely biased inference. In addition to discussion, this course will incorporate both interactive activities and hands-on, guided R programming exercises, to allow participants the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and tools that will translate to real-world analyses. It is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming language will be essential.

["motivation.html", "Motivation", " Motivation “One enemy of robust science is our humanity — our appetite for being right, and our tendency to find patterns in noise, to see supporting evidence for what we already believe is true, and to ignore the facts that do not fit.” — (“Let’s Think About Cognitive Bias” 2015) Scientific research is at a unique point in history. The need to improve rigor and reproducibility in our field is greater than ever; corroboration moves science forward, yet there is a growing alarm about results that cannot be reproduced and that report false discoveries (Baker 2016). Consequences of not meeting this need will result in further decline in the rate of scientific progression, the reputation of the sciences, and the public’s trust in its findings (Munafò et al. 2017; “How Scientists Fool Themselves – and How They Can Stop” 2015). “The key question we want to answer when seeing the results of any scientific study is whether we can trust the data analysis.” — Peng (2015) Unfortunately, at its current state the culture of data analysis and statistics actually enables human bias through improper model selection. All hypothesis tests and estimators are derived from statistical models, so to obtain valid estimates and inference it is critical that the statistical model contains the process that generated the data. Perhaps treatment was randomized or only depended on a small number of baseline covariates; this knowledge should and can be incorporated in the model. Alternatively, maybe the data is observational, and there is no knowledge about the data-generating process (DGP). If this is the case, then the statistical model should contain all data distributions. In practice; however, models are not selected based on knowledge of the DGP, instead models are often selected based on (1) the p-values they yield, (2) their convenience of implementation, and/or (3) an analysts loyalty to a particular model. This practice of “cargo-cult statistics — the ritualistic miming of statistics rather than conscientious practice,” (Stark and Saltelli 2018) is characterized by arbitrary modeling choices, even though these choices often result in different answers to the same research question. That is, “increasingly often, [statistics] is used instead to aid and abet weak science, a role it can perform well when used mechanically or ritually,” as opposed to its original purpose of safeguarding against weak science (Stark and Saltelli 2018). This presents a fundamental drive behind the epidemic of false findings that scientific research is suffering from (van der Laan and Starmans 2014). “We suggest that the weak statistical understanding is probably due to inadequate”statistics lite&quot; education. This approach does not build up appropriate mathematical fundamentals and does not provide scientifically rigorous introduction into statistics. Hence, students’ knowledge may remain imprecise, patchy, and prone to serious misunderstandings. What this approach achieves, however, is providing students with false confidence of being able to use inferential tools whereas they usually only interpret the p-value provided by black box statistical software. While this educational problem remains unaddressed, poor statistical practices will prevail regardless of what procedures and measures may be favored and/or banned by editorials.&quot; — Szucs and Ioannidis (2017) Our team at The University of California, Berkeley, is uniquely positioned to provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and spreading rapidly by many of his students and colleagues who have greatly enriched the field, the aptly named “Targeted Learning” methodology targets the scientific question at hand and is counter to the current culture of “convenience statistics” which opens the door to biased estimation, misleading results, and false discoveries. Targeted Learning restores the fundamentals that formalized the field of statistics, such as the that facts that a statistical model represents real knowledge about the experiment that generated the data, and a target parameter represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as a feature of the distribution that generated it (van der Laan and Starmans 2014). In this way, Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a principled standard for estimation, thereby inhibiting these all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight bias, confirmation bias, and outcome bias) from infiltrating analysis. “The key for effective classical [statistical] inference is to have well-defined questions and an analysis plan that tests those questions.” — Nosek et al. (2018) Our objective is to provide training to students, researchers, industry professionals, faculty in science, public health, statistics, and other fields to empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills to utilize the sound methodology of Targeted Learning — a technique that provides tailored pre-specified machines for answering queries, so that each data analysis is completely reproducible, and estimators are efficient, minimally biased, and provide formal statistical inference. Just as the conscientious use of modern statistical methodology is necessary to ensure that scientific practice thrives, it remains critical to acknowledge the role that robust software plays in allowing practitioners direct access to published results. We recall that “an article…in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures,” thus making the availability and adoption of robust statistical software key to enhancing the transparency that is an inherent aspect of science (Buckheit and Donoho 1995). For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is crucial that it is accompanied by robust user-friendly software (Pullenayegum et al. 2016; Stromberg and others 2004). The tlverse software ecosystem was developed to fulfill this need for the Targeted Learning methodology. Not only does this software facilitate computationally reproducible and efficient analyses, it is also a tool for Targeted Learning education since its workflow mirrors that of the methodology. In particular, the tlverse paradigm does not focus on implementing a specific estimator or a small set of related estimators. Instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework of Targeted Learning itself — all R packages in the tlverse ecosystem directly model the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical framework of Targeted Learning. What’s more, the tlverse R packages share a core set of design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be used in conjunction with each other and built upon one other in a cohesive fashion. In this workshop, the reader will embark on a journey through the tlverse ecosystem. Guided by R programming exercises, case studies, and intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted Learning statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world causal inference analyses. Participants need not be a fully trained statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory causal inference.

The tlverse is a new framework for doing Targeted Learning in R, inspired by the tidyverse ecosystem of R packages. By analogy to the tidyverse: The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. So, the tlverse is an opinionated collection of R packages for Targeted Learning sharing an underlying philosophy, grammar, and set of data structures 1.3 tlverse components These are the main packages that represent the core of the tlverse: sl3: Modern Super Learning with Pipelines What? A modern object-oriented re-implementation of the Super Learner algorithm, employing recently developed paradigms for R programming. Why? A design that leverages modern tools for fast computation, is forward-looking, and can form one of the cornerstones of the tlverse. tmle3: An Engine for Targeted Learning What? A generalized framework that simplifies Targeted Learning by identifying and implementing a series of common statistical estimation procedures. Why? A common interface and engine that accommodates current algorithmic approaches to Targeted Learning and is still flexible enough to remain the engine even as new techniques are developed. In addition to the engines that drive development in the tlverse, there are some supporting packages – in particular, we have two… origami: A Generalized Framework for Cross-Validation What? A generalized framework for flexible cross-validation Why? Cross-validation is a key part of ensuring error estimates are honest and preventing overfitting. It is an essential part of the both the Super Learner algorithm and Targeted Learning. delayed: Parallelization Framework for Dependent Tasks What? A framework for delayed computations (futures) based on task dependencies. Why? Efficient allocation of compute resources is essential when deploying large-scale, computationally intensive algorithms. A key principle of the tlverse is extensibility. That is, we want to support new Targeted Learning estimators as they are developed. The model for this is new estimators are implemented in additional packages using the core packages above. There are currently two featured examples of this: tmle3mopttx: Optimal Treatments in tlverse What? Learn an optimal rule and estimate the mean outcome under the rule Why? Optimal Treatment is a powerful tool in precision healthcare and other settings where a one-size-fits-all treatment approach is not appropriate. tmle3shift: Shift Interventions in tlverse What? Shift interventions for continuous treatments Why? Not all treatment variables are discrete. Being able to estimate the effects of continuous treatment represents a powerful extension of the Targeted Learning approach. 1.4 Installation Before installing packages, please update your version of R. The tlverse ecosystem of packages are currently hosted at https://github.com/tlverse, not yet on CRAN. You can use the devtools package to install them: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;tlverse/tlverse&quot;) The tlverse depends on a large number of other packages that are also hosted on GitHub. Because of this, you may see the following error: Error: HTTP error 403. API rate limit exceeded for 71.204.135.82. (But here&#39;s the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.) Rate limit remaining: 0/60 Rate limit reset at: 2019-03-04 19:39:05 UTC To increase your GitHub API rate limit - Use `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to create a Personal Access Token. - Use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add the token as `GITHUB_PAT`. This just means that R tried to install too many packages from GitHub in too short of a window. To fix this, you need to tell R how to use GitHub as your user (you’ll need a GitHub user account). Follow these two steps: Type usethis::browse_github_pat() in your R console, which will direct you to GitHub’s page to create a New Personal Access Token. Create a Personal Access Token simply by clicking “Generate token” at the bottom of the page. Copy your Personal Access Token, a long string of lowercase letters and numbers. Type usethis::edit_r_environ() in your R console, which will open your .Renviron file in the source window of RStudio. In your .Renviron file, type GITHUB_PAT= and then paste your Personal Access Token after the equals symbol with no space. In your .Renviron file, press the enter key to ensure that your .Renviron ends with a newline. Save your .Renviron file. Restart R for changes to take effect. You can restart R via the drop-down menu on the “Session” tab. The “Session” tab is at the top of the RStudio interface. After following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the package which threw the error above. This workshop has other dependencies, which you can install using the following linked script: install.R "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 The Roadmap of Statistical Learning 2.1 The Observed Data and Statistical Model 2.2 The Causal Model 2.3 The Parameter of Interest 2.4 Identifiability 2.5 Estimation: Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation 2.6 Inference", " Chapter 2 The Roadmap of Statistical Learning A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models and to do so with finite-sample robustness and consistent inference. 2.1 The Observed Data and Statistical Model Assume we have an i.i.d. sample of confounders, a binary intervention of interest, and an outcome, or are observed data is \\[ O = (W, A, Y).\\] The distribution of the observed data may be factorized as follows: \\[P(O) = P(W, A, Y) = P(W)P (A \\mid W) P(Y \\mid A, W).\\] To estimate a parameter of interest, a researcher need not necessarily be able to specify these whole or conditional distributions. Rather, each estimator only requires that certain parts of the distribution be known; for example, some may require estimates of \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid A, W)\\), the mean of \\(Y\\) within subgroups \\((A, W)\\), or the regression of the outcome on the exposure and confounders. At this stage in the roadmap, the researcher must specify a choice of statistical model to be used in estimating \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid A, W)\\) or other elements of the probability distribution needed to estimate the parameter of interest. Here, statistical model means any constraints on the model form that may be imposed by knowledge about the data-generating process – that is, known aspects of how the data were generated. Typically, the true model is a very large model, placing few constraints, if any, on the data-generating distribution, or a semi-parametric model. With few constraints on the data-generating distribution, and a potentially large number of covariates, data-adaptive, machine-learning approaches remain the only practical option for estimating components of the likelihood. The remainder of this course concerns how to do this as efficiently and robustly as possible, depending on the goal of the analysis. 2.2 The Causal Model The next step in the roadmap is to use a causal framework to formalize the experiment and thereby define the parameter of interest. Causal graphs are one useful tool to express what we know about the causal relations among variables that are relevant to the question under study (Pearl 2009). Ignoring error terms, we will assume the following ordering of the variables in \\(O\\). While directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) like above provide a convenient means by which to visualize causal relations between variables, the causal relations among variables can be represented via a set of structural equations: \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= f_A(W, U_A) \\\\ Y &amp;= f_Y(W, A, U_Y), \\end{align*}\\] where \\(U_W\\), \\(U_A\\), and \\(U_Y\\) represent the unmeasured exogenous background characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, \\(f_W\\), \\(f_A\\) and \\(f_Y\\) denote that each variable (for \\(W\\), \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively) is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but one typically has little information about particular functional constraints (e.g., linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and so may be used interchangeably. 2.3 The Parameter of Interest The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the whole population and observing the outcome, and then assigning no exposure to the whole population and observing the outcome. On the nonparametric structural equations, this corresponds to a comparison of the outcome distribution in the population under two interventions: \\(A\\) is set to \\(1\\) for all individuals, and \\(A\\) is set to \\(0\\) for all individuals. These interventions imply two new nonparametric structural equation models. For the case \\(A = 1\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= 1 \\\\ Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y), \\end{align*}\\] and for the case \\(A=0\\), \\[\\begin{align*} W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\\\ A &amp;= 0 \\\\ Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y). \\end{align*}\\] In these equations, \\(A\\) is no longer a function of \\(W\\) because we have intervened on the system, setting \\(A\\) deterministically to either of the values \\(1\\) or \\(0\\). The new symbols \\(Y(1)\\) and \\(Y(0)\\) indicate the outcome variable in our population if it were generated by the respective NPSEMs above; these are often called counterfactuals. The difference between the means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a parameter that is often called the “average treatment effect” (ATE), denoted \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:ate} ATE = \\mathbb{E}_X(Y(1)-Y(0)), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}_X\\) is the mean under the theoretical (unobserved) full data \\(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\\). Note, we can define much more complicated interventions on NPSEM’s, such as interventions based upon rules (themselves based upon covariates), stochastic rules, etc. and each results in a different targeted parameter and entails different identifiability assumptions discussed below. 2.4 Identifiability Because we can never observe both \\(Y(0)\\) (the counterfactual outcome when \\(A=0\\)) and \\(Y(1)\\), we cannot estimate directly. Instead, we have to make assumptions under which this quantity may be estimated from the observed data \\(O \\sim P_0\\) under the data-generating distribution \\(P_0\\). Fortunately, given the causal model specified in the NPSEM above, we can, with a handful of untestable assumptions, estimate the ATE, even from observational data. These assumptions may be summarized as follows The causal graph implies \\(Y(a) \\perp A\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\), which is the randomization assumption. In the case of observational data, the analogous assumption is strong ignorability or no unmeasured confounding \\(Y(a) \\perp A \\mid W\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\); Although not represented in the causal graph, also required is the assumption of no interference between units, that is, the outcome for unit \\(i\\) \\(Y_i\\) is not affected by exposure for unit \\(j\\) \\(A_j\\) unless \\(i=j\\); Consistency of the treatment mechanism is also required, i.e., the outcome for unit \\(i\\) is \\(Y_i(a)\\) whenever \\(A_i = a\\), an assumption also known as “no other versions of treatment”; It is also necessary that all observed units, across strata defined by \\(W\\), have a bounded (non-deterministic) probability of receiving treatment – that is, \\(0 &lt; P_0(A = a \\mid W) &lt; 1\\) for all \\(a\\) and \\(W\\). This assumption is referred to as positivity. Remark: Together, (2) and (3), the assumptions of no interference and consistency, respectively, are jointly referred to as the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). Given these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of \\(P_0\\), specifically \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:estimand} ATE = \\mathbb{E}_0(Y(1) - Y(0)) = \\mathbb{E}_0 \\left(\\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 1, W] - \\mathbb{E}_0[Y \\mid A = 0, W]\\right), \\end{equation}\\] or the difference in the predicted outcome values for each subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (\\(A = 0\\) vs. \\(A = 1\\)), in the population, averaged over all observations. Thus, a parameter of a theoretical “full” data distribution can be represented as an estimand of the observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing about the representation in that requires parametric assumptions; thus, the regressions on the right hand side may be estimated freely with machine learning. With different parameters, there will be potentially different identifiability assumptions and the resulting estimands can be functions of different components of \\(P_0\\). We discuss several more complex estimands in later sections of this workshop. 2.5 Estimation: Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation Although we will discuss more in later sections, the goals of the estimators we desire should be that, among sensible (asymptotically consistent, regular) estimators, the estimator be asymptotically efficient in the statistical model of interest, and the estimator can be constructed for finite-sample performance improvements, relative to other estimators in the same class. These principles guide our approach to estimation: Super Learning for prediction (more generally density estimation) and TMLE for estimation of our intervention parameters of interest. 2.6 Inference The estimators we discuss are asymptotically linear, meaning that the difference in the estimate \\(\\Psi(P_n)\\) and the true parameter (\\(\\Psi(P_0)\\)) can be represented in first order by a i.i.d. sum: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:IC} \\Psi(P_n) - \\Psi(P_0) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n IC(O_i; \\nu) + o_p(1/\\sqrt{n}) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(IC(O_i; \\nu)\\) (the influence curve or function) is a function of the data and possibly other nuisance parameters \\(\\nu\\). Importantly, such estimators have mean-zero Gaussian limiting distributions; thus, in the univariate case, one has that \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:limit_dist} \\sqrt{n}(\\Psi(P_n) - \\Psi(P_0)) \\xrightarrow[]{D}N(0,\\mathbb{V}IC(O_i;\\nu)), \\end{equation}\\] so that inference for the estimator of interest may be obtained in terms of the influence function. For this simple case, a 95% confidence interval may be derived as: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:CI} \\Psi(P^{\\star}_n) \\pm z_{1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{n}}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{n}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) is the sample variance of the estimated IC’s: \\(IC(O; \\hat{\\nu})\\). One can use the functional delta method to derive the influence curve if a parameter of interest may be written as a function of other asymptotically linear estimators. Thus, we can derive robust inference for parameters that are estimated by fitting complex, machine learning algorithms and these methods are computationally quick (do not rely on re-sampling based methods like the bootstrap).

We could, with available options, account for the clustering of the data (within sampled geographic regions), but, for simplification, we avoid these details in these workshop presentations, although modifications of our methodology for biased samples, repeated measures, etc., are available. We have 26 variables measured, of which 1 variable is set to be the outcome of interest. This outcome, \\(Y\\), indicates recurrent ischemic stroke within 14 days after randomization (DRSISC in ist); the treatment of interest, \\(A\\), is the randomized aspirin vs. no aspirin treatment allocation (RXASP in ist); and the adjustment set, \\(W\\), consists simply of other variable measured at baseline. In this data our outcome is occasionally missing, but we do not need to create a variable indicating this missingness (such as \\(\\Delta\\)) for analyses in the tlverse. If we let \\(\\Delta\\) denote the indicator that the outcome is missing such that \\(\\Delta = 1\\) when the outcome is observed and \\(\\Delta = 0\\) when the outcome is not observed, then we can denote our observed data structure as \\(n\\) i.i.d. copies of \\(O_i = (W_i, A_i, \\Delta_i, \\Delta Y_i)\\), for \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\).

The inclusion criteria were: clinical diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke, with onset within the previous 48 hours and no clear indication for, or clear contraindication to, treatment with aspirin or subcutaneous heparin. Unlike many stroke trials of that era (and subsequently), the study did not set an upper age limit. Patients were to have a CT brain scan to confirm the diagnosis of stroke, and this was to be done before randomisation if at all possible. To enter a patient in the study, the clinician telephoned a central randomisation service (at the Clinical Trial Service Unit, Oxford) during this telephone call, the baseline variables were entered and checked, and once validated, the computer allocated the treatment and the telephonist then informed the clinician. The patients and treating clinicians were not blinded to the treatment given. Early outcome data were collected by the treating physician who completed a follow-up form at 14 days, death or hospital discharge (whichever occurred first). This form recorded data on events in hospital within 14 days, and the doctor’s opinion on the final diagnosis of the initial event that led to randomisation. These unblinded data, may therefore be subject to some degree of bias. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were either dead or dependent on other people for activities of daily living at six months after randomisation. This outcome was collected by postal questionnaire mailed directly to the patient, or (in Italy) by telephone interview of the patient by a trained researcher, blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was therefore assessed - as far as practicable - blind to treatment allocation and hence should be free from bias. We re-checked the data set for inaccuracies and inconsistencies and extracted data on the variables assessed at randomisation, and at the two outcome assessment points: at 14-days after randomisation, death or prior hospital discharge (whichever occurred first) and at 6-months. — Sandercock, Niewada, and Członkowska (2011) 3.2 WASH Benefits Example Dataset The data come from a study of the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh (WASH Benefits Bangladesh): a cluster-randomised controlled trial (Luby et al. 2018). The study enrolled pregnant women in their first or second trimester from the rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised, using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were: chlorinated drinking water; improved sanitation; hand-washing with soap; combined water, sanitation, and hand washing; improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient supplements; and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. In the workshop, we concentrate on child growth (size for age) as the outcome of interest.

Updated: 2019-12-05 4.1 Learning Objectives Format right-censored survival data for MOSS. Fit a SuperLearner initial estimate of the conditional survival function of failure, conditional survival function of censoring and the propensity scores (initial_sl_fit). Calculate the TMLE adjustment of the conditional survival fit (MOSS_hazard). Formulate a simultaneous confidence band for the estimated conditional survival across a range of time-points (compute_simultaneous_ci). 4.2 Introduction In this section, we explore the MOSS R package. This software performs ensemble machine learning with the SuperLearner R package and One-Step Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) to estimate counterfactual marginal survival functions and the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on survival probabilities, while non-parametrically adjusting for measured confounding. This one-step TMLE can be executed via recursion in small local updates, and creates a doubly robust and semi-parametrically efficient estimator. Simultaneous confidence bands of the entire curve are also available for inference. 4.2.1 Existing Methods for Observational Survival Analysis To facilitate comparison with other estimation procedures, the following additional estimators are also included in the MOSS R package: Inverse Censoring Probability Weighted (IPCW) estimator, which re-weights the observed data by the inverse of the product of the propensity score and censoring probability before applying a standard estimation method (Rotnitzky and Robins 2014). Estimating Equation (EE) estimator, which improves IPCW by adding the sample mean of the efficient influence curve and is a locally efficient and double robust (Hubbard, Van Der Laan, and Robins 2000). TMLE works well to improve the statistical efficiency of EE Like EE, TMLE is also doubly robust and locally efficient. In contrast to these two methods, TMLE performs an adjustment on the estimate of the relevant part of the data-generating distribution before applying the parameter mapping and thus always respects the parameter space (probabilities falling inside [0,1]), a so-called substitution/plug-in estimator. As a result, is more robust to outliers and sparsity than non-substitution estimators. Motivating one-step TMLE: monotonic survival curve EE and TMLE utilize efficiency theory derived for univariate parameters, making estimation of the survival curve a collection of univariate survival probability estimators. This procedure can lead to a survival curve that is not monotonically decreasing. The one-step TMLE implemented in MOSS targets the survival curve as a whole and thus ensures monotonicity, while preserving the desirable performance of the point-wise TMLE (Cai and Laan 2019). 4.3 Using MOSS for One-Step TMLE for Time-to-Event Outcomes MOSS implementation consists of the following steps: Load the necessary libraries and data. Specify the right-censored survival data arguments. Estimate the (1) conditional survival function of failure event, (2) conditional survival function of censoring event, and (3) propensity score with the SuperLearner R package. Perform TMLE adjustment of the initial conditional survival fit. Compute standard error estimates for simulaneous inference. 0.

Specify right-censored survival data arguments The following variables need to be specified from the data so they can subsequently be used as required arguments for MOSS functions: W: dataframe of baseline covariates \\(W\\). A: binary treatment vector \\(A\\). T_tilde: time-to-event vector \\(\\tilde{T} = \\min(T, C)\\). Delta: censoring indicator vector \\(\\Delta = I(T \\leq C)\\). t_max: the maximum time to estimate the survival probabilities. We can specify these variables with our observed vet_data. T_tilde &lt;- vet_data$time Delta &lt;- vet_data$status A &lt;- vet_data$trt W &lt;- vet_data[, c(3, 6:9)] t_max &lt;- max(T_tilde) 2. Obtain initial estimates with SuperLearner R package We will use the initial_sl_fit() function to specify the data (as we defined it above) and the SuperLearner library for initial estimation of each of the following components of the likelihood: conditional survival function of failure event given treatment and confounders, conditional survival function for censoring event given treatment and confounders, and propensity score of treatment given confounders. We are forgetting one component of the likelihood that requires estimation: the joint distribution of confounders! In MOSS this estimation is done for us under the hood, and we do not use the SuperLearner. Do you recall why we do not use the SuperLearner to estimate the joint distribution of confounders nonparametrically? The conditional survival functions are estimated by first estimating the conditional hazard, and then transforming into the conditional survival function. For a thorough explanation of these procedure see Section 3 from (Cai and Laan 2019). Currently, MOSS requires the user to do this one-to-one tranformation from the conditional hazard to the conditional survival probabilities by calling the hazard_to_survival() method. We will address this later on. Back to initial_sl_fit() – we have the option to specify the following arguments in addition to the required data arguments. sl_failure: SuperLearner library for failure event hazard, default = c(“SL.glm”) sl_censoring: SuperLearner library for censoring event hazard, default = c(“SL.glm”) sl_treatment: SuperLearner library for propensity score, default = c(“SL.glm”) gtol: treshold for truncating propensity scores, default = 0.001) It is highly recommended that you specify a more complex library than the default. The SuperLearner library arguments take a vector of strings corresponding to learners available in the SuperLearner R package: https://github.com/ecpolley/SuperLearner/tree/master/R. We do not review the SuperLearner R package in these workshops, but a handy tutorial crafted a few years ago by our colleague Chris Kennedy is freely available: Guide to SuperLearner. # recall treatment was randomized SL.ranger.faster = function(...) { SL.ranger(..., num.trees = 50) } sl_lib_decent &lt;- c(&quot;SL.mean&quot;, &quot;SL.glm&quot;, &quot;SL.step.forward&quot;, &quot;SL.bayesglm&quot;, &quot;SL.ranger.faster&quot;, &quot;SL.gam&quot;) initial_fit &lt;- initial_sl_fit(T_tilde, Delta, A, W, t_max, sl_censoring = sl_lib_decent, sl_failure = sl_lib_decent) names(initial_fit) [1] &quot;density_failure_1&quot; &quot;density_failure_0&quot; &quot;density_censor_1&quot; [4] &quot;density_censor_0&quot; &quot;g1W&quot; The initial_fit object contains the fitted conditional densities for the failure events (density_failure_1 for test treatment group, density_failure_0 for standard treatment group), censoring events (density_censor_1 and density_censor_0 for test treatment and standard treatment groups, respectively), and propensity scores (a vector g1W).

Perform TMLE adjustment of the initial conditional survival estimate The one-step TMLE is carried out by many local least favorable submodels (LLFMs) (performed via logistic regressions) with small step sizes. The one-step TMLE updates in small steps locally along LLFM, ensuring that the direction of the update is optimal around the current probability density. This procedure permits updates to the conditional hazard for all points on the survival curve (or any high-dimensional parameter in general), so that the conditional hazard can be transformed into a monotone survival curve after the algorithm. At this point we are nearly ready to update the hazard using this constrained step size update. The only additional argument we need to define is k_grid: the vector of interested time points for estimation of the conditional survival probability. k_grid &lt;- 1:max(T_tilde) initial_fit$density_failure_1$t &lt;- k_grid initial_fit$density_failure_0$t &lt;- k_grid We perform the TMLE adjustment of the initial conditional survival estimate by first creating a MOSS_hazard or MOSS_hazard_ate object and then calling the iterate_onestep() method for this object. MOSS_hazard and MOSS_hazard_ate correspond to different estimators: MOSS_hazard: one-step TMLE of the treatment-specific survival curve, and MOSS_hazard_ate: one-step TMLE of ATE on survival probabilities One-step TMLE of the Treatment-Specific Survival # estimate survival curve for standard treatment group hazard_fit_standardA &lt;- MOSS_hazard$new( A, T_tilde, Delta, density_failure = initial_fit$density_failure_0, density_censor = initial_fit$density_censor_0, g1W = initial_fit$g1W, A_intervene = 1, k_grid ) psi_standardA &lt;- hazard_fit_standardA$iterate_onestep() # estimate survival curve for test treatment group hazard_fit_testA &lt;- MOSS_hazard$new( A, T_tilde, Delta, density_failure = initial_fit$density_failure_1, density_censor = initial_fit$density_censor_1, g1W = initial_fit$g1W, A_intervene = 2, k_grid ) psi_testA &lt;- hazard_fit_testA$iterate_onestep() One-step TMLE of ATE on Survival hazard_fit_ate &lt;- MOSS_hazard_ate$new( A, T_tilde, Delta, density_failure = initial_fit$density_failure_1, density_censor = initial_fit$density_censor_1, density_failure_0 = initial_fit$density_failure_0, density_censor_0 = initial_fit$density_censor_0, initial_fit$g1W ) psi_ate &lt;- hazard_fit_ate$iterate_onestep() summary(psi_ate) Min. 1st Qu.

Compute standard error estimates for simultaneous inference The simultaneous confidence bands for the survival curve estimates can be constructed based on asymptotic linearity of the TMLE uniform in all time points considered. After creating a vector of survival curve estimates by defining a new survival_curve object, we will estimate the efficient influence curve using the TML-estimates generated in the previous step. We obtain estimates for all times specified in k_grid by calling the all_t() method for eic objects. The eic estimates are obtained for each subject and time, so we construct a matrix of these estimates and calculate a simultaneous confidence band with this matrix by calling the method compute_simultaneous_ci().

["r6.html", "Chapter 5 A Primer on the R6 Class System 5.1 Classes, Fields, and Methods 5.2 Object Oriented Programming: Python and R", " Chapter 5 A Primer on the R6 Class System A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models. The tlverse is designed using basic OOP principles and the R6 OOP framework. While we’ve tried to make it easy to use the tlverse packages without worrying much about OOP, it is helpful to have some intuition about how the tlverse is structured. Here, we briefly outline some key concepts from OOP. Readers familiar with OOP basics are invited to skip this section. 5.1 Classes, Fields, and Methods The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and functions that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main types of elements: fields, which can be thought of as nouns, are information about an object, and methods, which can be thought of as verbs, are actions an object can perform. Objects are members of classes, which define what those specific fields and methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes (sometimes called base classes) – accordingly, classes that are similar, but not exactly the same, can share some parts of their definitions. Many different implementations of OOP exist, with variations in how these concepts are implemented and used. R has several different implementations, including S3, S4, reference classes, and R6. The tlverse uses the R6 implementation. In R6, methods and fields of a class object are accessed using the $ operator. For a more thorough introduction to R’s various OOP systems, see http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html, from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R (Wickham 2014). 5.2 Object Oriented Programming: Python and R OO concepts (classes with inherentence) were baked into Python from the first published version (version 0.9 in 1991). In contrast, R gets its OO “approach” from its predecessor, S, first released in 1976. For the first 15 years, S had no support for classes, then, suddenly, S got two OO frameworks bolted on in rapid succession: informal classes with S3 in 1991, and formal classes with S4 in 1998. This process continues, with new OO frameworks being periodically released, to try to improve the lackluster OO support in R, with reference classes (R5, 2010) and R6 (2014). Of these, R6 behaves most like Python classes (and also most like OOP focused languages like C++ and Java), including having method definitions be part of class definitions, and allowing objects to be modified by reference.
