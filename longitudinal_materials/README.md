These materials are made by Lina Montoya and Professor Maya Petersen at UC 
Berkeley. The labs are used for a course on causal inference with longitudinal 
data, and as such they **cannot be distributed or shared with others.** 

The `R` labs are an excellent resource for learning about longitudinal data 
analysis.
